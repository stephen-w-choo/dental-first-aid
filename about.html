            <h5>About this site</h5>
            The author is a practicing dentist located in Melbourne, Victoria. He was inspired to make this website after encountering two children 
            whose well-meaning parents had re-implanted their baby teeth after they had been knocked out. Which you should never do for baby teeth, by the way.
            <br>
            <br>
            All recommendations are based off the current international dental trauma guidelines (linked above), as well as the 
            author's own experience in dental practice.
