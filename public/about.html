            <h5>About this site</h5>
            All recommendations are based off the current dental trauma guidelines (linked above),
            as well as the author's own experience in dental practice.

            The author is a dentist located in Melbourne, who was inspired to make this website
            after encountering two children whose well-meaning parents had re-implanted their baby teeth after they
            had been knocked out. Which you should never do for baby teeth, by the way.
